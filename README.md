## Overview:

Docu-Scan is a file-scanning dictionary written in Java. The program allows users to scan in single or bulk documents to a single data-structure, compared against a dictionary. 
There is an included dictionary available, but users may supply their own. Users may also delete whole documents from the structure as well. 
Once the structure is populated, users may run any number of actions against it. Some of these actions include: Printing a general data overview (docs scanned, number of words, etc), printing the structure, exporting unique words to a .txt file etc.


## Instructions:

At the moment, Docu-Scan is meant to be run from the terminal from Main.java.

Several parts of the application require the user to input the location of documents to scan. You are welcome to scan from anywhere on your system. 
The application provides a number of example documents, and their input may look like this:

```
./data/dictionary.txt
```

or

```
./sample_texts/frankenstein.txt
```

At other points the application may only ask for a directory, such as with batch scanning or writing to a .txt file. 
This may be entered as the following:

```
./data
```

The application should continue to return to the main menu until the user exits the application.
